The require_tree directive has been removed from the asset pipeline manifest files. Addtional css/js files need to be specified.
This is to avoid bootstrap/jqtouch css conflicts.

See: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html

Includes:
- Bootstrap 2.3.0 / pagination gem
- DataTables
- SimpleForm (bootstrap 2.3 compatible)
- Fontawesome
- jQt (http://jqtjs.com/)

Mobile site (mobile_pages) uses a seperate layout template. jQt added directly into asset pipeline.
